<p><strong>
  The Persona Playground allows real users to act as a Testing Persona.
</strong></p>
<p>
  This <strong>Playground Edition</strong> of the platform is
  <strong>only for use with synthetic and public datasets.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Login as a testing persona by choosing one of the persona options
  from the list along the left. Permissions to resources will vary
  by persona. Typically the "Administrator" persona will have
  permission to modify system configurations, including adding or
  modifying other personas.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Please do not modify Administrator personas, and only modify
  configurations on your own "realm".</strong>
</p>
